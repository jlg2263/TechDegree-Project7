_______________________________________________________________________________________________
Used the very popular and in-demand React library to create an image gallery app. With the help of this powerful "MVC" (Model, View, Controller) library, the app is built in the style of modern single page applications to keep it fast, modular, and in sync with current web development trends.

Used best practices of working with React, like using JSX to write markup-like syntax directly in your JS files and managing state in a container component that passes data down to reusable stateless components. Used React supportive tools like the Create React App and React Router modules.

Used the powerful Create React App tool to et up the initial project.

Then:

Used JavaScript and JSX to build out the gallery components in a modular fashion.
Used React Router to set up routes for three default topic pages and a search page.
Used Axios to fetch data from the Flickr API and used it to display images in the app.
Added logic to handle the search and various requirements of the project.
Added to the supplied CSS to personalize the project.
